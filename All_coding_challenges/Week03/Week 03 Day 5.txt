Coding Challenges Week03 Day 05

Q1.The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down
to 1.
-->
Program:
num = 5

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial
Output:
The factorial of 5 is 120.

Q2.Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and
reverse it.

-->
Program:
word = input("Input a word to reverse: ")

for char in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):
  print(word[char], end="")
print("\n")
Output:
Input a word to reverse:ilapid
