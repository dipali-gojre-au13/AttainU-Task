Q1.Write the calculator program which will take input from users two numbers
And will ask them to type
0 for addition
1 for subtraction
2 for multiplication
3 for division
And will print the result
-->
num1 = int(input("Enter First Number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second Number: "))

print("Enter which operation would you like to perform?")
ch = input("Enter any of these char for specific operation +(0),-(1),*(2),/(3): ")

if ch == '0':
    result = num1 + num2
elif ch == '1':
    result = num1 - num2
elif ch == '2':
    result = num1 * num2
elif ch == '3':
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    print("Input character is not recognized!")

print(result)

Output:
Enter First Number: 3
Enter Second Number: 5
Enter which operation would you like to perform?
Enter any of these char for specific operation +(0),-(1),*(2),/(3): 0

Q2.Explain range in python with various examples.
-->
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
 
Syntax :range(start, stop, step)

start :An integer number specifying at which position to start. Default is 0
stop  :An integer number specifying at which position to stop (not included).
step  :An integer number specifying the incrementation. Default is 1

Example:
1.x = range(3, 20, 2)
for n in x:
  print(n)
-->
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
2.range(10, 3, -4)
--> 
10
6

Q3.What will be the result of
int(6.6) + int(4.9) = ?
--> int (6) + int (4) = 10
