Q1.Write short note on load balancer.
-->
Load balancing is a technique used to distribute workloads uniformly across servers or other compute resources to optimize network efficiency, reliability and capacity. Load balancing is performed by an appliance -- either physical or virtual -- that identifies in real time which server in a pool can best meet a given client request, while ensuring heavy network traffic doesn't unduly overwhelm a single server.

A load balancer may be:
A physical device, a virtualized instance running on specialized hardware or a software process.

Load balancing is the most scalable methodology for handling the multitude of requests from modern multi-application, multi-device workflows.

Q2.Write a short note on caching.
-->
Caching (pronounced “cashing”) is the process of storing data in a cache.

Caching is a very general technique for improving computer system performance. Based on the principle of locality of reference, it is used in a computer's primary storage hierarchy, its operating system, networks, and databases. Caching improves access time and reduces data traffic to data sources that have limited throughput.

Examples
1.primary storage caches - several levels of cache, including virtual memory, for storage of data and instructions used by executing programs

2.translation look-aside buffer - a cache for virtual memory page table entries

A cache is a temporary storage area. For example, the files you automatically request by looking at a Web page are stored on your hard disk in a cache

Q3.Write a short note on CDN
-->

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. This helps users around the world view the same high-quality content without slow loading times.

Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single end user request. This results in significant traffic to the origin and subsequent load, thereby increasing the chances for origin failure if the traffic spikes are exceedingly high or if the load is persistent.

Over half of the internet’s traffic is served by a content delivery network (CDN). The goal of the CDN is to reduce latency – the delay between submitting a request for a web page and the web page fully loading on your device – by reducing the physical distance that the request has to travel.


For example, a US visitor wishing to view content which originates at a UK-based server will experience poor loading times if this request has to travel across the Atlantic.


CDNs offer an easy way to increase the speed of a website while also lowering the latency. Therefore, they are essential for the fast, efficient and secure delivery of content to users around the world. This content is not simply limited to website content alone; it can also comprise 4K and HD-quality video, audio streams, apps, games and OS updates. With website visitor attention spans growing shorter by the day, it is imperative to deliver this content as quickly as possible.
