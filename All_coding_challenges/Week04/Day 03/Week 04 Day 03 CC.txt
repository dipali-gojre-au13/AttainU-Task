Q1.Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.
Eg [1,2,3,4] = 10
-->
# Python program to find sum of items in list 
total = 0
  
# creating a list 
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
  
# Iterate each items in list 
# and add them in variale total 
for ele in range(0, len(list1)): 
    total = total + list1[ele] 
  
# printing total value 
print("Sum of all items in given list: ", total)

Output:
Sum of all items in given list:10

Q2.Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list.
[1,2,33,4] = largest is 33
-->
# creating function
def max_num_in_list( list ):
    max = list[ 0 ]
    for a in list:
        if a > max:
            max = a
    return max
    # printing the largest element
print("The largest number in list is:", end="")
print(max_num_in_list([1, 2, 33, 4]))

Output:
The largest number in list is:33
