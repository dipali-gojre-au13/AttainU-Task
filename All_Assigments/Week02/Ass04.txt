#Assigment No.04 Day 5 

Write down all the operators present in python covered in class.And a brief description about them?
-->
There are four types of operators covered in the class they are:
1.Arithmetic operators
2.Comparison operators
3.Assignment Operators
4.Logical Operators

1.Arithmetic operators:This operators is used to perform arithmetic operation between two operands.
Just like Addition,substraction, divide, multiplication, reminder, Exponent.

e.g a+b , a-b ,a*b, a/b, a%b, **

2.Comparison operators:This operators are used to comparing the value of the two operands and returns Boolean true or false accordingly.
Just like eual to , greater than equal to, less than equal to, Greater than, Less than.
==, !=, <=, >=, <, >
e.g a==b , a!=b, a>=b, a<=b.

3.Assignment Operators:This operators are used to assign the value of the right expression to the left operand.
Just like =, +=, -=, *=, %=, **=, //=
e.g a=b, a+=b, a-=b, a*=b.

4.Logical Operators:This logical operators are used primarily in the expression evaluation to make a decision and return boolean true and false accordingly.
Just like and(&&) , OR(||), Not(~)
e.g a=10 , b=50
((a==b)and(a<b)OR(a>=b)
(False and True)OR False
False OR False
False
